            <p>
                I first encountered cross-stitching while at school during my home economics class and have
                not lifted a needle until a decade later.
            </p>
            <p>I started with a couple of generic cross-stitch designs, including various small
                scenic designs. It was not until I completed a nineteenth century artwork design that I realised my
                "true calling". Since then, I have recreated a few artworks in cross-stitch.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">I am eager to share my passion with you, and I hope I can help you to discover your way into the world of
                cross-stitch!</p>
