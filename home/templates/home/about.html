                <p>
                    I first encountered cross-stitching while at school during my home economics class and have
                    not lifted a needle until a decade later.
                </p>
                <p>I started with a couple of generic cross-stitch designs, including various small
                    scenic designs. It was not until I completed a nineteenth century artwork design that I realised my
                    "true calling". Since then, I have recreated a few artworks in cross-stitch.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">I am eager to share my passion with you, and I hope I can help you to discover your way
                    into the world of
                    cross-stitch!</p>
