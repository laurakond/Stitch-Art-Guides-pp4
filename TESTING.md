## Testing

### W3C Validator Testing
All files were put through W3C Markup Validation Service & W3C CSS Valisation Service. Images as per below:
- **W3C Markup**:
    <details>

    ![username-validation]()
    </details>

### User input validation

There are several user inputs throughout the application, therefore, validating data was crucial for the functionality of the application.
